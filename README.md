Construction Check
==================

Construction Check is a Web application I am developing to experiment and utilize Django (and eventually Angular2 or ReactJS).

I have broken the views file into composite pieces contained within a views directory, to modularize the methods. After inital development, I will probably modularize things further and make each model and its related files into their own apps within the Django project.

Goals for now:
* Make all the models
* Make all the views for basic CRUD operations for the models
* Make all needed urls
* Get basic rendering with HTML. Once back end is completed, implement Angular2 on front end
