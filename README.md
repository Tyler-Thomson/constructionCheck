Construction Check
==================

Construction Check is a Web application I am developing to experiment and utilize Django (and eventually Angular2 or ReactJS).
Django is being used to serve APIs, and will communicate with Angular.
I've implemented the Django-restful framework, and have been learning to use it, along with JWT (using simplejwt).

This is an app that will function as a checklist for custom houses, with general templates for the user to use and customize.

Goals for now:
* Finish implementing built-in Django authentication
* Finish implementing JWT to secure communications between the backend and front end.
* Make sure all models are communicating as they should be
